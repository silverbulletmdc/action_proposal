# Action Proposal Pytorch Framework

We implement a framework for the task of action proposals. And reproduce some algorithms based on
our framework. Note that this framework is almost writen by a low grade PhD student. Although I try
to make it more flexible and readable, but there are still many issues. Use this framework carefully.
